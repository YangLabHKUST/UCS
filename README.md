# UCS: a unified approach to cell segmentation for spatially resolved transcriptomics

This repository contains the code for the UCS method, a unified approach to cell segmentation for spatially resolved transcriptomics. UCS is a deep learning-based method that can be used to segment cells in spatially resolved transcriptomics data. UCS is based on a U-Net architecture and is trained on a dataset of spatially resolved transcriptomics images. UCS can be used to segment cells in spatially resolved transcriptomics data from different platforms.

## Installation


## Run
See `scrips` dir for examples on how to run UCS on Xenium data and Vizgen data.


## Downstream analysis
See `downstream` dir README for examples on how to run downstream analysis to reproduce most of the results in the paper.
