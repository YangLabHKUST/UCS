## Downstream analysis of UCS
This folder contains the downstream analysis of Xenium Breast Cancer and the visualization for Vizgen. Most of the figure in the paper can be reproduced here.

To run the downstream jupyter notebook, you should first download the data from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vhTHboLGF9jCb9vNuzHzaR8fU1Jg4qV5/view?usp=drive_link) in the ucs code dir.
And then set
```python
os.chdir('path/to/ucs')
```
at the beginning of the jupyter notebook.
